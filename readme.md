Had a lot of trouble out of the gate trying to figure out where to even start with this one. It took far longer than i care to admit to go through the existing code to figure out what exactly my job was. I'm pretty confident in my work in the models but honestly everything going on in server.js is not working and i dont know where to bugfix. On top of that my vs is bugging out and I dont know what is real anymore. Hopefully my tutor can help me fix this before anyone reads this.
